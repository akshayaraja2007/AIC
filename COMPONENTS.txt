Sensing & Threshold

NTC Thermistor 10 kΩ @ 25 °C – 1 piece → measures freezer temperature

Fixed resistor 10 kΩ (1%) – 1 piece → voltage divider with thermistor

Multiturn trimmer potentiometer 10 kΩ – 2 pieces → set undercool & overcool thresholds

Comparator & Support

LM393 Dual Comparator (DIP‑8 or SOIC‑8) – 1 piece → two comparators: undercool & overcool

Pull-up resistor 4.7 kΩ – 2 pieces → for LM393 open-collector outputs

Hysteresis resistor 100 kΩ – 2 pieces → prevents output chatter

Outputs & Drivers

NPN transistor 2N2222 or BC547 – 1 piece → drives piezo buzzer

Passive piezo buzzer 5 V – 1 piece → alarm output

LEDs – 3 pieces (Red = undercool, Green = normal, Blue = overcool)

LED series resistors 2.2 kΩ – 3 pieces

Power & Decoupling

0.1 µF ceramic capacitor – 1 piece → decoupling near LM393

10 µF electrolytic capacitor – 1 piece → stabilize power supply

1N4001 diode – 1 piece → optional, reverse-polarity protection

5 V regulated supply → 1 unit (USB module or 7805 + 7–12 V input)

Mechanical / Assembly

Perfboard or small PCB – 1 piece

Small enclosure / project box – 1 piece

Hookup wires / sensor leads – as needed

Solder, flux, screw terminals – as needed
